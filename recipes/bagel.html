    <img src="../images/bagel.webp" alt="Example of the dish">
    <p>These simple bagels have a wonderful cinnamon and pumpkin flavor.</p>
    <p>Making bagels is fun, but it is a little bit of work. Follow our signature recipe for the perfect texture and flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast</li>
        <li>⅔ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>¾ cup canned pumpkin</li>
        <li>⅓ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornmeal</li>
        <li>6 cups water, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>



    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl; add pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves and
        mix well. Stir in enough flour to make a soft dough. Turn dough onto a work surface and knead by hand 6 to 8 minutes or
        mix in a stand mixer. Transfer dough to a greased bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let rise in a warm place until
        doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch dough down and divide into 8 balls. Poke a hole in the middle of each ball using your finger to create a bagel
        shape. Arrange bagels on a baking sheet and let rise, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with 6 cups water and white sugar and bring to a boil. Slightly flatten the bagels and drop a couple at
        a time into the boiling water; cook for 1 1/2 minutes. Flip bagels and boil for another 1 1/2 minutes; remove with a
        slotted spoon and dry on a clean towel. Repeat with remaining bagels.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and sprinkle cornmeal on the
        sheet. Arrange bagels on the baking sheet about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
